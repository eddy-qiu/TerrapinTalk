# TerrapinTalk - https://ec3163b7b6fcc45d12.gradio.live
TerrapinTalk is a OpenAI-powered mental health and wellness chatbot for use by UMD students. This web app was created for the Diamondhack by DBK at the University of Maryland, College Park.

In light of recent stressors and academics, my vision for this chat bot was to create a product for use by students - for free - to have "someone" to talk to and ask for advice. This chat bot acts as a therapist as well as a friend to the student, who is open to listening and helping the student out with their mental and overall health.

This app serves the information needs of the University of Maryland by providing instantaneous, prompted responses specifically trained on:
- Resources and Support
- Educational Content
- Event and Workshop Listings
- Anonymous Support
- Self-Assessment Tools
- Crisis Management   
...and other resources at UMD!

I believe that my digital product/tool is...  

**Valuable**: It solves a real problem - UMD is ranked #42 for most depressed! But in all seriousness, the University is creating initiatives to support student body mental health - https://sph.umd.edu/news/fearless-focus-mental-health 

**Feasible**: This idea is feasible through technology. The only cost of running it would be the OpenAI API tokens, but is definitely worth it to run and can be funded/sponsored by various campus initiatives.  

**Usable**: The MVP of this idea is very staightforward to use - through future iterations and development, this app could be even more user-friendly and aesthetic!  

**Demo**:
